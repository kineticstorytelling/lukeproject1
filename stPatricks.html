        <p class="stPatText">It is the National Cathedral of the Church of Ireland and the largest cathedral in the country. Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver’s Travels, was dean of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral in the 1700s and he is one of many burials on site. The phrase "to chance your arm" originates from a feud that played out within the walls of St Patrick's. The cathedral is world famous for its choir, established in 1432, which still performs daily during school term. In recent years the Lady Chapel, dating from 1270, has been restored to its original glory.</p>
