                Arthur Guinness began by brewing ale at St. James’s Gate. In the 1770s, he began brewing ‘porter’, a new type of English beer, invented in London in 1722 by a brewer named Ralph Harwood. Porter was different from ale because it was brewed using roasted barley, giving the beer a dark ruby colour and rich aroma. Arthur’s porter was successful and in 1799 he decided to stop brewing ale altogether, and concentrate on porter alone

        <p class="guinText">Arthur Guinness was the first in a long line of Guinness Master Brewers. The traditional craft of brewing at St. James’s Gate Brewery was handed down from generation to generation. Arthur most probably developed his passion for brewing from his father, Richard, brewing for the Archbishop of Cashel. Arthur’s son Benjamin
            followed in his father’s footsteps becoming Master Brewer in 1803, while his brother, Arthur concentrated on business development. In the mid 19th Century the craft of brewing was continued by the Brewery partners, the Purser family. The brewers were the executives of the Company, the Master Brewer, the most
            senior of the brewers. In 1885 there were 12 brewers, with an average annual salary of £1,000. They entered as apprentices and were mainly of Guinness or Purser
            connections, though from time to time an ‘outsider’ was admitted. In 1886 the position of Master Brewer was held by W.P. Geoghegan, a great-nephew of John
            Tertius Purser, who had come into the Brewery in 1859. The Master Brewer before W.P. Geoghegan had been G.A. Walle
